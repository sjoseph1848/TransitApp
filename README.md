# TransitApp

This is a simple React application that I completed to work on functional components. 

The app showcases the use of ES6 syntax in terms of map, filter and the spread operator. 

Time allowing: 

   I will try to add the functionality to the app so that it will respond to the user driven events. 

   I will also try to update the CSS to make it look nicer as well.
